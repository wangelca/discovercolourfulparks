parks.csv - parkID, parkName, parkDescription, parkLocation (FOR BC AND ALBERTA ONLY - scope shortened as these are the most popular to visit)
spots.csv - spotID, parkID, spotName, spotDescription, spotadultPrice, spotchildPrice, spotLocation (FOR BC AND ALBERTA ONLY)
Notes - 
Would prefer we randomize the spotID but to make that section pop up on VSCode, I decided on the following order
First number is parkID, second number (1) is the number for spots, third number is the third spot in that park
Ie: Banff Gondola - 111 (1 = parkID, 1 = spot numerical ID, 1 = first spot in the park)
    Golden Skybridge - 112 (1 = parkID, 1 = spot numerical ID, 2 = second spot in the park)
